        <strong>Designed for Individual Use:</strong> Because Spectrum Guide
        stores data directly on your device, each account is linked to a single
        device. This means user progress, chat history, and personalized
        insights cannot be transferred between devices. To ensure seamless
        access to tailored support, we recommend using the same device for all
        Spectrum Guide interactions.

        <strong>Privacy and Data Security:</strong> At Spectrum Guide, we
        prioritize your privacy. All chat history and generated stories are
        stored locally on your device, not on external servers. This ensures
        that your personal data and the sensitive details of your loved ones'
        lives remain confidential and under your control. We commit to not using
        external databases for storing these personal interactions, safeguarding
        your information against unauthorized access.
